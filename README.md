# My-Rabbitry
My first real project

MyRabbitry

MyRabbitry is a rabbit–management system designed to simplify farm operations for hobby farmers, large farms, and industrial-scale operations.
It provides tools for tracking rabbit information, managing pregnancies, viewing farm statistics, generating family trees up to the 4th generation, and much more.

Their username and password are written in the application.properties file.

🗂 Project Structure

MyRabbitry follows a feature-based architecture, grouping files by functionality instead of type.
This helps keep the project scalable, organized, and easy to maintain.
